# A Firefox extension

This extension overlays a `<div>` on every page (once it is enabled of course) on the left-hand side of the web page. It lists the cookie name/value pairs that are accessible to it through JavaScript.

To enable it on Firefox, execute the following steps:

1. Type `about:debugging` into your browser's address bar.
2. Click the `This Firefox` icon on the top-left.
3. Click the `Load Temporary Add-on` button and navigate to the `manifest.json` file.

You are done, the extension is now available.

Navigate to any page of your choice and you should see the cookie information on the left. To disable the extension, simply click the `Remove` button on the `This Firefox` panel for this extension.
